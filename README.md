### Final project
The Final project was implemented as an analysis of compartmental models <br/>
in predicting the progression of COVID-19 
and can be found [here](https://github.com/raymondw99/Compartmental-Models).

Parts of the codes have been based upon the previous work of [Axel Strömberg](https://github.com/axelstr/Simulation_and_modeling)
and [Erik Weilow](https://github.com/eweilow/simulation-and-modeling).
